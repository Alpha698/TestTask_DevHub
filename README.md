The player controls artillery. Enemy mobs are coming at him from several sides, which he must shoot back. Mobs are destroyed with 1 shot. The reload time between artillery shots is 3 seconds. If a mob reaches the player's artillery within firing range, after a short delay a shot is fired and the player loses.
